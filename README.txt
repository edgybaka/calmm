The Calm Canvas App pioneers a seamless fusion of goal tracking, introspection, and
leisure activities, tackling the issues of fragmented well-being tools. Prioritizing data
security, the app ensures robust privacy measures. It promotes holistic development by
integrating goal management with personal reflection, addressing the constraints of
one-dimensional platforms. Calm Canvas engages users through a mix of introspective
and goal-oriented features, ensuring a flexible and enjoyable experience. Redefining
digital well-being tools, the app stands as a secure, comprehensive, and entertaining
platform, empowering users to lead balanced and satisfying lives.

HIGH LEVEL ARCHITECTURE
The high-level architecture of the Calm Canvas application encompasses several key
components:
I. User Interface (UI): This layer includes the graphical elements that users interact
with, such as journal entry forms, goal tracking tables, mood submission interfaces,
and gaming panels. It is designed using Java Swing components for a visually
appealing and user-friendly experience.
II. Application Logic: The core functionality of Calm Canvas resides in this layer. It
involves methods and algorithms for handling journal entries, goal tracking, mood
submissions, and gaming interactions. The Java programming language is employed
for its versatility and ease of development.
III. Database Layer: The application interacts with a MySQL database to store and
retrieve user data. This layer manages tables for journal entries, goals, mood
records, and game scores. SQL queries are used to perform database operations.
IV. Exception Handling: Throughout the application, robust exception handling is
implemented to manage unexpected scenarios gracefully. This ensures a smooth
user experience and provides meaningful feedback in case of errors.
V. Security Measures: Security features are embedded to safeguard user data. Java's
built-in security capabilities, along with secure database practices, contribute to
protecting sensitive information.
VI. Platform Independence: Java's platform independence is leveraged, allowing the
Calm Canvas app to run seamlessly on different devices with a Java Virtual Machine
(JVM).
VII. Scalability: The architecture is designed to scale, accommodating potential
enhancements and adjustments to meet evolving user requirements.
Overall, the high-level architecture ensures a well-rounded and secure well-being
platform, providing users with a comprehensive and enjoyable experience.

The Calm Canvas App project will be carried out using the following thorough
methodology:
I. Analysis of Requirements:Examine user requirements, taking into account input
from experts and prospective users. Specify features for goal-tracking, journaling,
mood-tracking, and leisure gaming.
II. Design and Implementation of Databases:Create a safe relational database structure
and apply SQL queries to manage user information, including scores from games,
goals, journals, and accounts.
III. Designing User Interfaces (UI):Work together to create a UI that is visually appealing,
intuitive, and prioritizes ease of use and simplicity for a better user experience.
IV. Security and Authentication:Adopt safe authentication and encryption strategies to
protect sensitive data and user accounts while adhering to industry norms.
V. Progress:Apply the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture using Java and Swing.
Add third-party libraries for improved user interface elements.
VI. Testing:To verify usability, carry out thorough user acceptability testing in addition to
unit and integration testing.
VII. Implementation and Observation:Make sure it can scale by deploying on a secure
server. Use monitoring tools to keep an eye on performance and receive updates on
time.
VIII. Constant Enhancement:After the app launches, gather user feedback, make
iterations based on insights, and update the software frequently to include new
features, improve security, and cater to changing customer needs.
